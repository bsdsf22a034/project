Creative Mind - Introduction to Data Science Project
Project Overview
This is my first repository related to the Introduction to Data Science project. The project name is Creative Mind, where we will explore fundamental concepts and techniques used in data science. This project will involve the use of various data science tools and libraries to analyze, visualize, and extract insights from data.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

Learning the basics of data science and its real-world applications.
Gaining proficiency in using data analysis tools like Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Practicing Git commands to manage project versions and collaborate with others.
Documenting the process, findings, and learnings using markdown files and code comments.
Tools and Technologies
We will be using the following tools and technologies for this project:

VS Code: For code editing and running Python scripts.
Git Bash: For executing Git commands and managing version control.
Python: As the programming language for data analysis.
Jupyter Notebooks: To document and visualize data analysis steps.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
Git Workflow
Throughout this project, we will make extensive use of Git commands to manage our work. Below are some key commands we'll use:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git add: Stage changes to be committed.
git commit: Commit changes to the repository with a message.
git push: Push changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
git pull: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
git branch: Manage branches for feature development.
git merge: Merge changes from different branches.
We will be running these commands via VS Code or Git Bash, depending on personal preference.
